  # ===========================================
  # LOKI - Log Aggregation System
  # ===========================================
  # Loki is like a database for logs. It receives logs from Promtail and stores them efficiently.
  # Unlike traditional logging systems, Loki only indexes metadata (labels), not the log content,
  # making it fast and cheap to run.
  loki:
    # Using version 2.9.2
    image: ${LOCALOBS_LOKI_IMAGE}:${LOCALOBS_LOKI_TAG}

    # Expose port 3100 for:
    # - Receiving logs from Promtail via HTTP API (/loki/api/v1/push)
    # - Serving log queries from Grafana (/loki/api/v1/query_range)
    # - Health checks (/ready)
    ports:
      - "3100:3100"

    volumes:

      - ./config/loki-config.yaml:/etc/loki/local-config.yaml

      # Named volume for persistent storage of log data
      # Loki stores logs in "chunks" (compressed log data) and an "index" (metadata for queries)
      # Without this volume, all logs would be lost when container stops
      # Data location inside container: /tmp/loki (configurable in loki-config.yaml)
      - loki-data:/tmp/loki

    # Useful for development - survives system reboots and crashes
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Health check: Docker will mark service as "healthy" or "unhealthy"
    # Other services use this to wait until Loki is ready before starting
    healthcheck:
      # Command to check if Loki is ready to accept requests
      # /ready endpoint returns 200 when Loki is fully initialized

  # PROMTAIL - Log Shipper (Collector)
  # ===========================================

  # and ships them to Loki. Think of it as the "delivery truck" for logs.
  promtail:

      # Why it matters:
      # - Prevents sending duplicate logs after restart
