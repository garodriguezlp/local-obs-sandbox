# ===========================================
# PROMTAIL CONFIGURATION (RAW JSON PRESERVED)
# ===========================================
# This is an ALTERNATIVE configuration to promtail-config.yaml
#
# KEY DIFFERENCE: This configuration preserves the original JSON structure in Loki
#
# WHY USE THIS:
# - You want to see the complete JSON in Grafana
# - You want all fields available (including "thread" which is missing in the formatted version)
# - You prefer to parse JSON on-demand in queries: {job="spring-boot"} | json
# - You're learning Loki and want to understand how JSON parsing works
#
# TO USE THIS CONFIG:
# 1. In docker-compose.yml, change the volume mount:
#    - ./config/promtail-config-raw-json.yaml:/etc/promtail/config.yml
# 2. Restart Promtail: docker-compose restart promtail
# 3. Generate fresh logs: jbang scripts/generate-logs.java batch 50
# 4. Query in Grafana: {job="spring-boot"}
#
# See docs/JSON-LOGS.md for detailed comparison and explanation

# === SERVER CONFIGURATION ===
server:
  # HTTP port for Promtail's metrics and status endpoints
  # Access metrics at: http://localhost:9080/metrics
  http_listen_port: 9080

  # Disable gRPC (not needed)
  grpc_listen_port: 0

  # Logging level for Promtail's own logs
  log_level: info

# === POSITIONS TRACKING ===
# Tracks which log lines have been read to prevent duplicates on restart
positions:
  # File where positions are stored (persisted in Docker volume)
  # Format: /var/log/spring-boot/app.log: 12345
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

# === LOKI CLIENT CONFIGURATION ===
clients:
  - # Loki's push endpoint
    url: http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push

    # Network timeout
    timeout: 30s

    # Retry policy for failed sends
    backoff_config:
      min_period: 500ms      # Start with 500ms delay
      max_period: 5m         # Cap at 5 minutes
      max_retries: 10        # Give up after 10 attempts

# === SCRAPE CONFIGURATIONS ===
scrape_configs:
  # === SPRING BOOT JSON LOGS (RAW PRESERVATION MODE) ===
  - job_name: spring-boot-logs

    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - localhost

        # === LABELS ===
        # Same static labels as the formatted version
        labels:
          job: spring-boot
          app: demo-app
          environment: local
          __path__: /var/log/spring-boot/*.log

    # === MINIMAL PIPELINE (KEY DIFFERENCE!) ===
    # This pipeline extracts ONLY what we need for labels and timestamp
    # It does NOT reformat the log message, so the original JSON is preserved
    pipeline_stages:
      # === STAGE 1: JSON PARSING (Minimal Extraction) ===
      # If a line isn't valid JSON, this stage will fail gracefully and skip it
      # Updated to match actual JSON fields from sample logs
      - json:
          expressions:
            # Extract timestamp (corrected from "timestamp" to "ts")
            ts: ts

            # Extract for labels
            level: level
            application: application

            # Removed trace_id and span_id as they are not in the sample
            # Add back if your logs include them

      # === STAGE 2: TIMESTAMP EXTRACTION ===
      # Updated source to "ts"
      - timestamp:
          source: ts
          format: RFC3339

      # === STAGE 3: MINIMAL LABELS ===
      - labels:
          level:
          application:

      # === NO TEMPLATE STAGE ===
      # Original log line preserved

# === WHAT YOU GET IN GRAFANA ===
# With this configuration, when you query {job="spring-boot"} you'll see:
#
# {"ts":"2023-01-15T10:30:45Z","level":"INFO","thread":"http-nio-8080-exec-1",...}
# {"ts":"2023-01-15T10:31:22Z","level":"ERROR","thread":"scheduler-1",...}
#
# The COMPLETE JSON structure, including all fields!

# === HOW TO WORK WITH RAW JSON IN GRAFANA ===
#
# 1. View raw JSON:
#    {job="spring-boot"}
#
# 2. Parse and extract specific fields:
#    {job="spring-boot"} | json | line_format "{{.thread}} - {{.logger}}: {{.message}}"
#
# 3. Filter by extracted fields:
#    {job="spring-boot"} | json | thread="http-nio-8080-exec-1"
#
# 4. Search within message (still works):
#    {job="spring-boot"} |= "exception"
#
# 5. Pretty-print all fields:
#    {job="spring-boot"} | json | line_format "{{.}}"

# === COMPARISON: RAW vs FORMATTED ===
#
# THIS CONFIG (Raw JSON):
# ✅ Complete JSON visible
# ✅ All fields available (thread, logger, exception details, etc.)
# ✅ Flexibility - parse differently for different queries
# ✅ Nothing is lost
# ❌ Less readable at first glance
# ❌ Need to parse in every query
#
# promtail-config.yaml (Formatted):
# ✅ Clean, human-readable messages
# ✅ Fields already extracted
# ✅ Faster queries (no parsing needed)
# ❌ Original JSON lost
# ❌ Fields not in template are invisible
# ❌ Can't change formatting later

# === BEST PRACTICE ===
# For learning: Use this config (raw JSON)
# For production: Decide based on your needs
#   - Need all fields preserved? Use raw
#   - Want simpler queries? Use formatted
#   - Or create a hybrid: extract more fields but keep original JSON

# === PERFORMANCE NOTE ===
# Raw JSON is NOT slower than formatted!
# - Storage: same size (actually slightly smaller without template overhead)
# - Query speed: depends on whether you parse in query or not
# - Indexing: same (labels are extracted either way)
