I have and end goal of learning about loki and grafana with the end goal to be able to have a nice local way to manage my spring boot json lines logs

I want to spin up a stack using docker compose so that I can insely push those logs into this stask and they query them and filter them and shape them conveniently 

I want you to create a fully comprehensive guide, fully in markdown explaining the conceptual, part, each part individually, how to pull, how to run each container indevidually 

how to check the version compatibilty matrix

how to check each piece of the puzzle independencly, either via web ui, or httpie, just to seee things are live

this first 

and also theory of the role that each piece place

then start connectin the things 

and explaining in each part how things are wired, puligns or config needes, 

then finally ending in a docker file that I'd use for that

also I need to generate a spring book like json lines logs to test this setup
